This code is provided "as is" and on an "as available" basis, without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

The failure of the Providers to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this disclaimer shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
