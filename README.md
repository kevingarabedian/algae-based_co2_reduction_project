The project leverages the natural CO2 absorption capability of algae to convert CO2 into biomass through photosynthesis. This research paper presents the concept, design, and implementation of a prototype algae bio-reactor system controlled by Arduino microcontrollers, along with an analysis of the CO2 reduction potential, estimated costs, and scalability of the system. The primary goal is to create a viable solution that can be deployed in various settings, contributing to global efforts in combating climate change.

## 1. Introduction

Climate change poses a significant threat to the planet, with rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and various environmental issues resulting from the increased levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the primary GHGs contributing to climate change, and reducing CO2 emissions is a critical step towards mitigating the impacts of global warming.

Algae, known for their excellent capacity to convert CO2 into biomass through photosynthesis, offer a promising solution to reduce CO2 emissions. Algae can grow rapidly under controlled conditions and have a higher CO2 absorption rate compared to terrestrial plants. This research paper focuses on the development of an algae bio-reactor system using Arduino microcontrollers to create a scalable and efficient CO2 reduction solution.

## 2. System Design and Components

The prototype algae bio-reactor system consists of the following components:

1. Transparent container for algae culture
2. LED light source for algae growth
3. Sensors to monitor temperature, turbidity, CO2 levels, and algae concentration
4. Solenoid valve and flow meter to control the addition of liquid-based food
5. Manual trigger and relay or actuator for food release

The Arduino microcontrollers are responsible for monitoring and controlling the bio-reactor's environment. The system adjusts parameters such as light intensity, temperature, and food supply to optimize algae growth and CO2 absorption. Moreover, the Arduino system periodically reports statistics to a website, enabling users to visualize the combined impact of multiple reactors on CO2 reduction.

## 3. Algae Types and Byproducts

Potential algae species for this project include Chlorella and Spirulina, known for their high CO2 absorption rates, rapid growth, and biomass production. Byproducts generated from the harvested algae biomass can be used for various purposes, such as biofuel production or as a food source for humans and animals.

## 4. CO2 Reduction Potential and Scalability

The table below shows the potential CO2 reduction using various numbers of reactors:

As the table demonstrates, the CO2 reduction potential of the algae bio-reactor system can be significantly increased by scaling up the number of reactors. The system is designed to be modular and easily expandable, allowing for the deployment of multiple reactors in various settings, such as residential, commercial, or industrial areas.

## 6. Meeting XPRIZE Requirements

The XPRIZE Carbon Removal competition focuses on solutions capable of removing at least 1,000 tons of CO2 per year from the atmosphere. With approximately 1,015 reactors operating simultaneously, the algae bio-reactor system can meet the minimum requirement of 1,000 tons of CO2 removal per year. Scaling up the number of reactors further will lead to even greater CO2 reduction, showcasing the potential of this project in combating climate change.

## 6a. Global Impact

Removing 1,000 tons of CO2 per year from the atmosphere can have a significant impact on mitigating climate change. To put it in perspective, 1,000 tons of CO2 is equivalent to the emissions from about 222 cars per year, or the amount of carbon sequestered by about 940 acres of US forests in a year. Therefore, removing 1,000 tons of CO2 annually can make a noticeable contribution towards reducing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and preventing their negative impacts on the environment.

Scaling up the number of algae bio-reactors to remove 5,000 tons per year would require approximately 5,075 reactors operating simultaneously. Removing 25,000 tons annually would require 25,375 reactors, 50,000 tons would require 50,750 reactors, and 100,000 tons would require 101,500 reactors.

The process of removing CO2 with algae bio-reactors involves using algae to convert CO2 into biomass, which can then be harvested and used as a biofuel or a feedstock for other products. This process not only removes CO2 from the atmosphere but also has the potential to produce valuable products that can help to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.

By scaling up the number of algae bio-reactors, we can significantly increase the rate of CO2 removal from the atmosphere and help to reverse climate change. With a large-scale deployment of algae bio-reactors, we can reduce the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, slow down the rate of global warming, and mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on our environment, such as sea level rise, ocean acidification, and more severe weather patterns.

So assuming that we could get 1% of the 140 million homes in the United States to have bioreactors and that each bioreactor removed 1,000 tons of CO2 per year, this would result in a total annual CO2 removal of:

(0.01) x (140 million) x (1,000 tons) = 14 million tons of CO2 per year.

If we assume a global scenario, where 1% of the estimated 2.4 billion households had bioreactors and each bioreactor removed 1,000 tons of CO2 per year, this would result in a total annual CO2 removal of:

(0.01) x (2.4 billion) x (1,000 tons) = 240 million tons of CO2 per year.

While these estimates are hypothetical, they demonstrate the potential impact of widespread adoption of bioreactors in residential homes on mitigating climate change by removing large amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere. However, it's important to note that bioreactors are just one solution among many for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and a combination of different strategies will likely be needed to address the scale of the climate crisis.

## 7. Conclusion

The Algae-based CO2 Reduction Project demonstrates the potential of using algae in controlled bio-reactors to mitigate climate change by reducing CO2 emissions. The system leverages Arduino microcontrollers to monitor and manage the bio-reactors, ensuring optimal conditions for algae growth and CO2 absorption. The project's scalability, CO2 reduction potential, and cost-effectiveness make it a promising solution for global efforts to address climate change.

## 8. Reward Concept "Biocoin"

The concept of the proof-of-use reward system for the Algae-based CO2 Reduction Project is an exciting innovation that we believe could incentivize more people to participate in the project.

The basic idea is to create a new cryptocurrency, "biocoin," that would be awarded to users who operate the algae reactors. The biocoin would be based on a blockchain network that is specifically designed for the project. Users who want to participate in the reward system would need to download a software program that connects to the blockchain network and tracks their reactor usage.

The program would automatically record the amount of time the reactor is running and calculate the number of biocoins earned. The more a user runs the reactors, the more biocoins they would earn. The biocoins could then be redeemed for various rewards, such as discounts on energy bills or other environmentally-friendly products and services.

By leveraging blockchain technology, we could create a transparent and secure system for rewarding users who contribute to the project's goals. This would help to incentivize more people to adopt sustainable practices and reduce their carbon footprint.

Of course, this is just a conceptual idea at this stage. There would be many technical details that would need to be worked out, such as the design of the blockchain network and the smart contract that governs the issuance of biocoins. However, we believe that this idea has the potential to be a powerful tool for promoting sustainable practices and encouraging people to participate in the fight against climate change.
